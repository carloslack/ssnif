    Ssnif

    I will leave this here as a reminder how horrible this code is:

    But still works tho :P

    Found this code by accident, while searching on an old HD.
    This is a sniffer I started writing back then in 2002 and then moved on to something else.

    After a quick look it is really ugly and certainly has lots of bugs - a major refactor is needed
    and I might take it up as a hobby later on, just for fun.

    For now it is nice to have it here, as bad code as it is I still had fun writing it years ago,
    and it was quite useful I remember.

## Compile
    make

## Run
    (must be ROOT)
    # ./ssnif --help
